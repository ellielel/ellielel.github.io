    <h1>Ellie woz 'ere!</h1>
    <h2>Past Me</h2>
    <p>Way back in the 1980's, I loved using the BBC Micro and took part in the ambitious 
      - and obsolete - Domesday Project. Read all about it
      <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20130502084610/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h2>Present Me</h2>
    <p>These days, I parent my daughters and encourage them to have fun with tech too. They are starting to enjoy 
      block coding with Scratch and making animations and games. It's just me and them 
      so I'm bringing them up to be feisty, brave and adventurous. </p>

    <h2>Future Me</h2>
    <p>I'm excited to learn Web Dev because it's time to use my energy, creativity and 
      passions in ways that are better for me. I like designing patterns, making lino 
      prints, forest bathing and foraging for wild edible plants. </p>
